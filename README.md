# Machine-Learning-Projects
This Repository contains all **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** Projects that I have completed in the form of **ipython** Notebook along with the dataset used in **csv** form.

## Projects:

1. [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/Fakhruddin12/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Breast-Cancer-Prediction/Breast_Cancer.ipynb) : A model to predict whether or not a pateint has breast cancer using **SVM classifier**. Obtained around **96%** accuracy along with **ZERO False Negative** cases.

2. [Car Miles-Per-Gallon Prediction](https://github.com/Fakhruddin12/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Car-mpg-Prediction/Car-mpg-Prediction.ipynb) : Analysed the data using **statistical techiques** and by doing **Exploratory Data Analysis**. Finally, trained A regressor model using The **Random Forest** Algorithm. The dataset was obtained from the UCL Machine Learning Repository.

3. [House-Sales Prediction](https://github.com/Fakhruddin12/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/House-Sales-Prediction/House-sales-prediction.ipynb):Analysed the data by **Exploratory Data Analysis** and used the various techniques provided by **feature_column** of the **tensorflow** library like **bucketized  column** , **crossed column** etc. to make new **features**. Finally, trained a **Deep and Wide Neural Network Regression model** using the **functional API** of the **tensorflow** library to predict house prices.

4. [TMDB Box Office Prediction](https://github.com/Fakhruddin12/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction/TMBD_Box_Office_Prediction.ipynb): Analysed the data by rigorous **Exploratory Data Analysis** to extract as much information as possible from the dataset. Made new features using the original features after careful **EDA**. Then first trained a **Random Forest Regressor** using the default **hyperparameters** and then later used **RandomizedSearchCV** and **GridSearchCV** to find better set of **hyperparameters**.
